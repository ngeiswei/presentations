1) Explain about meta reasoning

- learn how to drive a car

- learn how to drive a car driver

- etc, turtles all the way up

- how to avoid turtles all the way up?

- In the 90s a young research became obsessed with that
problem, so obsessed that he in fact solve it, at least theoretically.

How did he do that you may ask?  He combined 3 ideas:

1. Let's unify all these machines into one, so instead of having a
learner, a meta-learner, a meta-meta-learner, etc, as separate
entities, they become a single entity, a single machine.

2. Let's have the action space of that machine, not only about the
external world, such as driving a car, but also about its internal
world, more specifically actions to rewrite the content of any its
memory cells, not just those carrying data but program instructions as well.

3. Let's only allow to trigger those actions, if we have a
mathematical proof that it is indeed a good idea.

For the rest of the talk we will focus primarily on that third idea.
And BTW, the research in question is Jurgen Schibhubber, and that
unified machine is the Goedel Machine.

2) TBD
